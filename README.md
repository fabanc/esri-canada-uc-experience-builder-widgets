This a set of examples used at our Esri Canada User Conferences about developing widget with Experience Builder.


## Working with feature layers

This folder contains 4 exercises that walks you from:
 - 1 Starting an empty widget
 - 2 Adding a configuration item to set a data source
 - 3 Reference a data source
 - 4 Connect the widget with a trigger, and modify its content based on the current extent.
 
 
## Useful tips:

### Existing code: 

When you download Experience builder, inspire yourself with :
 
  - the samples that already exists: `D:\Experience Builder\arcgis-experience-builder-1.1\client\dist\widgets\samples`
  - the widgets that already exists: `D:\Experience Builder\arcgis-experience-builder-1.1\client\dist\widgets\common`
